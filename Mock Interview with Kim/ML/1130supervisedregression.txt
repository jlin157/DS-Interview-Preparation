Supervised Learning: 
    Linear regression
	1. four assumption for linear regression
		what tool or how do you identify homoscedasticity and normality?
	2. R^2 vs. adjusted R^2
	3. MAE vs. MSE
	4. How do you reduce model complexity of a regression model?
	5. how do you deal with multicollinearity

	6. OLS

    Decision Tree
	1. Entropy
	2. IG
	3. Gini Impurity

	grid search
    Random Forest
	1. benefit
	2. what is the diff between xgboost and a rf
 	3. why rf , we don't need to deal with missing value
	4. more acceptible to outliers
    Gradient Bossting Tree
           Adaboost
           CatBosst 
           Light GBM
           XGBoost
    Neural Network

Bias vs. Variance
